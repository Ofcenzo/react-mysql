# Full Stack Developer Challenge (React - Node/Express - MySQL)
*"Design a web application that allows employees to submit feedback toward each other's performance review"*
---

## Description of the application
### Basic structure
The application is a basic employee performance review tool. It has the following functionality:
- List all employees
- Add/remove/update/view employees
- Add/update/view performance reviews

### Technology used
- React on the client side
- Node.js/Express on the server side
- MySQL database

## Instructions on installation and running
The code is split in two parts:
- server-side (in the `server` folder)
- client-side (in the `client` folder)
The application needs both the server and the client to run concurrently. In the development environment this is achieved by by running the two in separate terminal windows.

### Server
- Change to the `server` directory
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to run the server at http://localhost:3001

### Client
- Change to the `client` directory
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to build the React project and open http://localhost:3000 in a new browser window
